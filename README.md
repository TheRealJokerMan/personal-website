# My Website

My personal website is a fork of [Astro Nano](https://astro.build/themes/details/astronano/).

Astro Nano is a static, minimalist, lightweight, lightning fast portfolio and blog theme, which is
built with Astro, Tailwind and Typescript, an no frameworks. It was designed as an even more
minimal theme than my popular theme [Astro Sphere](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-sphere)
